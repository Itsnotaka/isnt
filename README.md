# isnt

isnt (stands for `Iron-Session-Next-Tailwind`) is a local cookie auth template built on top on [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/);

I find the given example within the [Iron-Session-Example](https://github.com/vvo/iron-session/tree/main/examples/next.js-typescript) kind of hard to understand at the start with a couple features that seems to be a little too much as a template.

# Documentation

I believe the file structure is simple enough and I don't have interest in making a document right now.

# Features

Please see [iron-session](https://github.com/vvo/iron-session).
